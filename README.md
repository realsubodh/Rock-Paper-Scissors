# Rock-Paper-Scissors
A interesting game "Rock-Paper-Scissors" designed by me with the help of Python. 

This game is using the Tkinter library of Python.
"Tkinter" allows user to design the frontend/layout in Python.
Rest of the things used in this game are just basic functions organised by if-else commmands.
You can play this game in your local PC by using Pycharm or IDLE.
After the over of game the system will tell you whether you have lose the game or not.
